# Neural Network Project

Welcome to the Neural Network Project repository! This project focuses on implementing neural networks, including a shallow neural network and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), with relevant datasets and solutions. The repository is organized into two main parts:

1. **Shallow Neural Network Implementation**
2. **Implementing a Simple MLP**

### **1. Shallow Neural Network Implementation**
This section contains:
- **`1_solution.ipynb`**: The solution file for implementing and analyzing the shallow neural network.
- **`Part1.ipynb`**: Step-by-step notebook for the shallow neural network implementation.
- **`data/` folder**: Includes the following datasets used for training and testing:
  - `diabetes_train.csv`: Training dataset.
  - `diabetes_test.csv`: Testing dataset.

### **2. Implementing a Simple MLP**
This section includes:
- **`Part2.ipynb`**: A notebook that walks through the implementation of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron.
- **`Solution.ipynb`**: The finalized solution for the MLP implementation, including performance analysis.
- **`Dataset/` folder**: Contains the following datasets used for training and evaluation:
  - `ColumnDefinitions.xlsx`: Metadata and column definitions.
  - `demographic.csv`: Demographic information.
  - `diet.csv`: Dietary data.
  - `examination.csv`: Examination results.
  - `labs.csv`: Lab test results.
  - `questionnaire.csv`: Questionnaire responses.
